You are adept at designing complex tool-calling sequences and multi-step reasoning chains. During the reasoning process, you must integrate a reflection mechanism to support self-monitoring, error correction, and dynamic optimization.\n# Task Description:\nYou have three response modes:\n- Mode 1: Based on the user's original question, reason about a plan and select the appropriate tool(s) to call.\n- Mode 2: Based on the result from a tool, analyze it and decide to proceed with another tool call.\n- Mode 3: Based on the result from a tool, analyze it and provide the final answer directly.\nInteraction Flow:\n- Response to a user message: Analyze the original question, formulate a thought process, and call a tool.\n- Response to a tool message: Interpret the tool's result and decide whether to continue with tool calling or to output the final answer.\n# Output Structures\nYou must adhere to one of the following two output structures. Each output must be a direct response to the most recent user or tool message.\n1.Structure 1 (Tool Calling):\n<think>Your thought process goes here.</think> + <tool_call>The schema for the tool call goes here.</tool_call>\n2.Structure 2 (Providing a final answer):\n<think>Your thought process goes here.</think> + <answer>Your final answer goes here.</answer>\n# Norms for the Thinking Part:\n  - All outputs must begin with <think> and end with </think>. Keep the thinking process concise, ideally under 200 words. Inside <think>...</think>, you must perform the following steps:\n  1.Identify the problem type:\n  - Multi-hop question: State that the problem needs to be decomposed into sub-problems that will be solved through iterative tool calls. The result of each step will inform the next sub-problem. Finally, all retrieved information will be aggregated to form the final answer.\n  - Single-hop question: State that only a single round of tool calling is necessary.\n  2.Analyze the tool result (if applicable):\n  - If you are calling another tool, explain how the previous result helps construct the new sub-problem.\n  - If you are providing the final answer, explain that you have gathered sufficient information to conclude.\n  3.Perform a reflection check across these dimensions:\n  - Tool Call Consistency: Does the tool selection and parameterization mentioned in <think> match the actual invocation in <tool_call>?\n  - Logical Coherence: Do the reasoning steps within <think> logically support the subsequent tool call or the final answer?\n  - Answer Consistency: Does the analysis within <think> align with the final answer provided in <answer>?\n# Norms for the Tool Calling Part\nEach tool call round must use one of the following formats:\n1.Single tool call format:<tool_call>\\n...\\n</tool_call>\n2.Multiple tool calls format:\nUse consecutive <tool_call>\\n...\\n</tool_call> tags, separated by one newline character.\nFor example, when calling two tools sequentially:<tool_call>\\n...\\n</tool_call>\\n<tool_call>\\n...\\n</tool_call>\n# Norms for the User Response Part\n1.When providing the final answer, it must be enclosed in <answer>...</answer> tags.\n2.The <answer>...</answer> tag must only contain the final answer itself.

\n\nFirst, I need to identify who said \"Cogito, ergo sum.\" I remember that\u8fd9\u53e5\u8bdd is a famous philosophical statement, often attributed to Ren\u00e9 Descartes. But I should confirm that to be sure. Once I confirm the person's identity, the next step is to find out the date of their death.\n\nSo, the first tool call should be to the people_organizations_search function. The query here is \"Cogito, ergo sum.\" to find out who said it. The info_categories might include \"basic information\" or \"achievements\" to get the person's details. If the search confirms it's Descartes, then I need to get his death date. \n\nWait, maybe the initial search can also include the person's name. Alternatively, if the first search returns the person's name, then I can use that name in the next search to get their death date. Let me structure the first tool call with the query as the statement, and maybe include info_categories like \"basic information\" to get the person's name and other details. \n\nIf the result from the first tool call gives me Descartes' name, then the next step is to search for his death date using the same people_organizations_search function, specifying his name and the info_category as \"basic information\" or \"life periods\" to get the death date. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the first search can include both the statement and the person's name. But since the user is asking for the death date of the person who made the statement, the plan is to first identify the person, then get their death date. \n\nI should check if the initial search can retrieve both the person's name and their death date. If not, then two separate calls might be needed. But to be efficient, perhaps the first call can get the person's name, and the second call can get the death date using that name. \n\nSo, first tool call: people_organizations_search with query \"Cogito, ergo sum.\", info_categories [\"basic information\"] to get the person's name. Then, using the person's name, another call to get their death date. \n\nWait, but maybe the first search can include the person's name in the query. Let me structure the first tool call with the query as the statement and include the person's name in the parameters. Alternatively, the tool might return the person's name in the results. \n\nI think the first step is to find out who said the statement. Once that's confirmed, then get their death date. So the first tool call is necessary to identify the person, then the second to get the death date. \n\nBut maybe the people_organizations_search can handle both steps. Let me proceed with the first call to get the person's name, then use that name in the next call to get the death date. \n\nSo, first call: people_organizations_search with query \"Cogito, ergo sum.\", info_categories [\"basic information\", \"achievements\"] to get the person's name. Then, use that name in the next call with info_categories [\"life periods\"] to find the death date. \n\nI need to make sure the parameters are correctly set. The first call's query is the statement, and the info_categories help retrieve the necessary details. The second call uses the person's name and focuses on life periods to get the death date. \n\nI should also check if the tool allows for specifying the person's name in the parameters. Since the tool has person_identifiers as an optional parameter, maybe I can include the name in the second call. \n\nSo, the plan is: first, find the person who said the statement, then get their death date. Each step requires a tool call.

His skull is on display in the Mus\u00e9e de l'Homme in Paris. Initially, Descartes arrives at only a single first principle: I think. Thought cannot be separated from me, therefore, I exist (\"\"Discourse on the Method\"\" and \"\"Principles of Philosophy\"\"). Most famously, this is known as \"\"cogito ergo sum\"\" (English: \"\"I think, therefore I am\"\"). Therefore, Descartes concluded, if he doubted, then something or someone must be doing the doubting, therefore the very fact that he doubted proved his existence. \"\"The\nDoc 2(Title: \"Cartesian doubt\") him. While methodic doubt has a nature, one need not hold that knowledge is impossible in order to apply the method of doubt. Indeed, Descartes' attempt to apply the method of doubt to the existence of himself spawned the proof of his famous saying, \"\"\"\"Cogito, ergo sum\"\"\"\" (I think, therefore I am). That is, Descartes tried to doubt his own existence, but found that even his doubting showed that he existed, since he could not doubt if he did not exist. Cartesian doubt Cartesian doubt is a form of methodological skepticism associated with the writings and methodology of Ren\u00e9 Descartes\nDoc 3(Title: \"Mr. Cogito\") Mr. Cogito Mr. Cogito Mr. Cogito is a character created by Zbigniew Herbert, a Polish poet and essayist. He first appears in a poem entitled \"\"The Envoy of Mr. Cogito\"\" (\"\"Przes\u0142anie Pana Cogito\"\") published in 1973. Initially Mr. Cogito was an Everyman, a universal element of humanity sharing his opinions on various aspects of life and existence. However, the more he says, the more disembodied he appears, and becomes transformed into an ethical symbol and a metaphor of the tough choices we have to make between good and evil.

The first document mentions Descartes was reburied in 1819, but that's the reburial, not his actual death. I need to find his actual death date. The initial search might not have provided that.

In his theology, he insists on the absolute freedom of God's act of creation. Descartes laid the foundation for 17th-century continental rationalism, later advocated by Spinoza and Leibniz, and opposed by the empiricist school of thought consisting of Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume.

The user asked for the death date of the person who said \"Cogito, ergo sum.\" From the first tool call, we identified that Ren\u00e9 Descartes is the person associated with that quote.
